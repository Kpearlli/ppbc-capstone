#Problem statement 
Developing an automated system to assess the eligibility of learners upon course completion and understand the overal performance of the learners. 

#A brief summary of my solution to the problem. 
The data needed will be in a few separate Google sheet. 
First, the data will be cleaning and work on the missing values.
Join the necessary info into a dataframe. Simple data analysis will be done to understand the learners performance according to courses.
Then, from the combined_dataframe, identify the learners who are eligible to receive certificates. The criteria will be listed.
This solution is important because 
(1) we can understand a little more on learners performance ans satisfaction scores; 
(2) automate the process so that work could be done more effectively and lesser manual work.

#A summary of your technical solution. This can include more technical descriptions of the work you did.
1. using pandas to read the google sheet file
2. check on the missing values
3. join the dataframe into 1 on learners ID
4. run analysis like, the top 10 students in the course, number of learners in each course
5. plot 1 or 2 graphs to observe patterns
6. create a function to run through some conditions and find out whether a particuar learner will be eligible for a certificate

#A brief summary of each of the files in your repository.
1. jupyter notebook file with all the working steps
2. py file on the automation for certificate
