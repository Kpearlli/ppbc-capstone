#Problem statement 
Developing an automated system to assess the eligibility of learners upon course completion and understand the overal performance of the learners. 

#A brief summary of my solution to the problem. 
The data needed will be in a few separate Google sheet. First, the data will be cleaning and work on the missing values.
Join the necessary info into a dataframe. Simple data analysis will be done to understand the learners performance according to courses.
Then, from the combined_dataframe, identify the learners who are eligible to receive certificates. The criteria will be listed.
This solution is important because (1) we can understand a little more on learners performance ans satisfaction scores; (2) automate the process so that work could be done more effectively and lesser manual work.
